Further still, the presence of respiratory symptoms in AIDS patients should stimulate more vigilant efforts to uncover other or additional infections. This case report highlights the pitfalls of diagnosing a rare pulmonary infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.","2021","07","12","New Microbiol","The new microbiologica","AIDS; COVID19; Disseminated Nocardiosis; HIV; Nocardia cyriacigeorgica; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; COVID-19; Coinfection; Humans; Nocardia Infections; Pandemics; Registries; SARS-CoV-2","Bruno","Raffaele","Division of Infectious Diseases I, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy",NA

As pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases can spread the disease between populations through travel, it is important to incorporate mobility between populations into the epidemiological modelling.
