No effective treatment for COVID-19 has been established yet. TMPRSS2 is essential for viral spread and pathogenicity by facilitating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 onto host cells. The protease inhibitor camostat, an anticoagulant used in the clinic, has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities against COVID-19. However, the potential mechanisms of viral resistance and antiviral activity of camostat are unclear.
