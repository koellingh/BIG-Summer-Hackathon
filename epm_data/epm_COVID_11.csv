However, this brief essay identifies the Anthropocene as a Western-bred phenomenon, which has evolved from Europe's colonial past. Pandemics are not new to settler colonialism, for instance. In this broader framework, the Covid-19 pandemic comes at a time when the West is confronting a new challenge to its global influence, i.e. the climate emergency resulting from a long history of colonial experiments, successes and failures.","2021","07","09","J Public Health (Oxf)","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)","Anthropocene; climate change; colonialism; pandemic; second Copernican revolution","Rivas","Virgilio A","Philosophy Department, Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Manila 1016, Philippines",NA
