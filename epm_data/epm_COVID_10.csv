If we believe it is important to use limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to protect the most vulnerable and prevent deaths, then available doses should be allocated with significant priority to older adults. Yet, we should resist the conclusion that age should be the sole criterion for COVID-19 vaccine prioritisation or that no younger populations (eg, those under the age of 60) should be prioritised until all old","2021","07","16","J Med Ethics","Journal of medical ethics","COVID-19; communicable diseases; ethics; policy; public policy","Smith","Maxwell J","Faculty of Health Sciences, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada maxwell.smith@uwo","maxwell.smith@uwo.ca"
